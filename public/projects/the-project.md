  <h3>My Genesis</h3>
  <p>It was my first major project in Singapore University of Technology and Design. This project was the project that sparked something in me to design solutions that solves real world problems, not just any solutions but solutions that matters.</p>

  <p>Design Thinking and Innovation is a foundational design course specifically developed for all SUTD freshmore students. I was exposed to design themes including principles, design processes, modes of thinking and analysis, and social and cultural aspects of design.</p>
  
  <p>Together with a team of six, we developed Luminova — an interactive shelter that uses light and shadow to create an immersive, sensory experience.</p>

  <h3>The Problem</h3>
  <p>Located within Changi Business Park—also known as the CBD of the East—we were tasked with selecting a site and designing a solution that enhances social interaction through the use of light, while addressing user pain points.</p>

  <p>The open space outside Changi City Point was chosen for its strong potential to facilitate a solution that delivers tangible social benefits. The site's limitation lies in its lack of sufficient shelter. The exisiting shelter provides limited coverage to the open plaza, rendering it inaccessible during any rainy periods or uncomfortably hot afternoons.</p>

  <h3>The Solution</h3>
  <p>Given the diverse user base, our proposed solution aims to introduce a designated communal space that not only fosters social interaction but also elevates the overall user experience.</p>

  <p>We were to deliver two prototypes. One a scaled model of our solution with respect to the site, the other a functional model of how our solution works. </p>

  <h3>Endless Nights...</h3>
  <p>After weeks of relentless effort and endless nights toiling over every detail, the project finally came to life. Each setback was met with determination, each challenge pushed us to think deeper, work harder, and refuse to settle for less. What began as a rough idea slowly shaped by perseverance, refined by sleepless hours, and fueled by the quiet belief that this work mattered. The journey wasn’t easy, but it was worth every moment.</p>

  <p>What really pushed us forward was the effort each member poured into the project. Seeing one another stay up late, troubleshoot tirelessly, and give their all became a quiet but powerful motivator. It wasn’t just about personal responsibility—it became about not wanting to let each other down. The more effort we saw, the more we wanted to give. It created a kind of unspoken momentum, where each person’s commitment inspired the next, driving us to push past our limits together.</p>

  <h3>D-Day</h3>
  <p>As we presented to our professors, words couldn’t capture the surge of emotions I felt. Watching my team give everything to bring our idea to life, and reflecting on the journey we shared, was deeply moving. That moment sparked something in me—a genuine passion to design not just solutions for the sake of innovation, but ones that genuinely serve and uplift others.</p>
