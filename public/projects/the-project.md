      <h3>The Project</h3>
      <p>It was my first major project in Singapore University of Technology and Design. This project was the project that sparked my passion in designing solutions that solves real world problems, not just any solutions but solutions that matters.</p>
      <p>Design Thinking and Innovation is a foundational design course specifically developed for all SUTD freshmore students. I was exposed to design themes including principles, design processes, modes of thinking and analysis, and social and cultural aspects of design.</p>
      <p>Together with a team of six, we developed Luminova — an interactive shelter that uses light and shadow to create an immersive, sensory experience.</p>
